# Application Status Health Check

This health check verifies that application is up and runnning based on `IHostApplicationLifetime`.

application won't be able to receive new requests.

- `name`: The health check name. Default if not specified is `applicationstatus`.
- `failureStatus`: The `HealthStatus` that should be reported when the health check fails. Default is `HealthStatus.Unhealthy`.
- `tags`: A list of tags that can be used to filter sets of health checks.
- `timeout`: A `System.TimeSpan` representing the timeout of the check.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services, IHost)
{
    services
        .AddHealthChecks()
        .AddApplicationStatus();
}
```
